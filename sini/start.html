agency Friend é Loyal, is cleaning up their lost-and-found-box before a long 

holiday. He sees a little camera. It has been a year since it was found, and the tag 

says: ”Löydetty Sibeliusmonumentin juurelta” , which means: found from at the 

feet of the Sibelius-monument.

Rami is in a delighful mood. He switches on the camera and browses the 

pictures... 


It seems the owner is a real globetrotter! Colosseum, that shell-like opera house, 

a gigantic red rock in the middle of nowhere, the Great Wall, tropical beaches, 

crowded streets of India… the list is so long.


Strangely, almost all pictures are about a sight or a beautiful landscape. There is 

hardly any picture focusing on people. It seems the owner isn’t that interested in 

people at all! But, the last picture is an exception: it’s from Paris. Two friends are 

hands on each other’s shoulders, posing at the Eiffel Tower. One looks like 

Indian, the other one caucasian. 


Wait! The caucasian person looks familiar to 

Rami. Rami recognizes Paul, a friend Rami got to know during his student 

exchange year in Toulouse. Nowadays Paul is a restaurant keeper in Paris. Could 

this camera belong to Paul? If not, then it must belong to that Indian guy. Rami 

must find it out… </div>
